"""cc-sessions: a hook-fed session ledger for Claude Code, plus a memory-pressure daemon.

Everything in this package runs on the system python3 (3.9, stdlib only), because the
hook path (`cc-sessions hook <Event>`) executes on every Claude Code event. The iTerm2
daemon (daemon/cc_sessions_daemon.py) imports this package from a python that has the
`iterm2` module.
